<p CLASS=indent>During my wife's second pregnancy with our daughter, Emily, I kept this journal to keep our friends and family up to date on this adventure. Also I saw this as an oportunity to document this experience for Emily.
<p CLASS=indent>
The only thing that has changed since it's first posting is some formating changes over time, the entries themselves have remained the same.

<p class=indent><u><b>07-15-03:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa had another prenatal visit this morning. Today we were able to hear the baby's heart beat. That was something that didn't happen until very late in the pregnancy with Hope.
<p class=indent>Lisa has been on some pretty powerful anti-nausea medication for almost two months now. Up until recently she took two doses or more a day. It didn't cure her morning sickness, but it did help her to keep enough food and liquids down that she and the baby are healthy. Now she is down to one pill a day and hopefully soon she can stop taking it all together.
<p class=indent>One side effect of the morning sickness is that Lisa has continued to loose weight during this pregnancy. Which is something that happened during the last pregnancy also. In just the last 30 days she has lost over 20 pounds.
<p class=indent><font size=2>It's been a while since I have had the time to update this journal, I wish I would have been able to get to it before now. I will try to do a better job of updating this journal.</font>
<hr>
<p class=indent><u><b>05-21-03:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa had to take the entire day off today.  She had to go back in for yet another IV. She was also able to see the doctor. He gave her the pill form of the IV medication that they have been giving her. This is the same medication that worked for her during her last pregnancy.
<hr>
<p class=indent><u><b>05-20-03:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa spent a couple hours in the clinic this afternoon. She was very sick and dehydrated. She had to have an IV.  This is the second one so far this pregnancy. It takes two hours to give her the IV.  She gets a liter of vitamins and zofran, then she gets a liter of latated rings.
<hr>
<p class=indent><u><b>05-14-03:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we went to our first prenatal visit. We took Hope with us, which turned out to be a mistake.  Lisa wanted to leave Hope with a baby sitter, but I thought we could handle her.  I was wrong. <img src="../../graphics/smile008.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" align="bottom"> I had forgotten how small those obgyn department rooms were.
<p class=indent>The due date is December 15<sup>th</sup>. We are currently 9 weeks into the 40 week process. The doctor gave Lisa some new medications to help curb the morning sickness.  He said it should only last about another month. <img src="../../graphics/smile003.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" align="bottom"> However, last time it lasted the entire pregnancy. I sure hope that he is right.
<p class=indent>Lisa had an ultrasound this afternoon. We have a picture that I might post in a day or two. Since we are so early in the pregnancy you really can't make anything out in the photo.
<hr>
<p class=indent><u><b>05-13-03:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today Lisa went into the clinic this afternoon for an IV. She was there for several hours while they gave her fluids and nausea medication. That morning sickness has already kicked into high gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="../../graphics/smile053.gif" alt="" width="15" height="20" align="middle">

<p class=indent><u><b>05-11-03:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I recently found out that we are going to be parents for the second time. <img src="../../graphics/smile004.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" align="middle"></p>
