<p class=indent>In July of 1999 my paternal grandfather, Harold Kingsley, died of cancer. Therefore it is important to me to include this page. 
<p class=indent>Below you will find some general information on lymphoma. I gathered this information from various sources including the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America, Inc.
<p class=indent>In the bottom section of this page you will find links to sites and organizations containing more indepth information. You may find these sites useful if you know someone with cancer. I try my best to keep these links up to date, but if you find any mistake or have any suggestions please <script type="text/javascript">myCodedStuff2();</script> me.</p>

<p class=indent>Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a connecting network of glands and vessels which manufacture and circulate lymph throughout the body. Lymph is a colorless, watery fluid that contains white blood cells called lymphocytes. Along the network of vessels are groups of small, bean-shaped organs called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are clustered in the neck, under the arms, in the groin, and abdomen. The lymph nodes make and store infection-fighting cells. The spleen, thymus, and tonsils are also part of the lymph system.</p>
<p class=indent>Like all types of cancer, lymphomas are diseases of the bodies cells. Healthy cells grow, divide, and replace themselves in an orderly manner. When lymphoma occurs, cells in the lymphatic system grow abnormally. They divide too rapidly and grow without any order or control. Too much tissue is formed and tumors begin to grow. Because there is lymph tissue in many parts of the body, the cancer cells may spread to other organs such as the liver or spleen or into the bone marrow.</p> 
<p class=indent>Lymphomas are divided into two sub-types; Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's. The two are distinguished by cell type. They share similar symptoms such as painless swelling of the lymph nodes, fever and fatigue. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are more common with at least 15 different types. Hodgkin's generally occurs in individuals between 15-40 years of age, while non-Hodgkin's generally occurs in individuals between 30-70 years of age. </p>
<p class=indent>Some forms of lymphoma have no cure, some are treatable for a time and some sustain long or complete remissions. Doctors are often frustrated by the lack of new and effective treatments. In addition, current treatments are not without some possible long term risks, such as new malignancies resulting from chemotherapy or radiation.</p>
<p class=indent>Today, Hodgkin's lymphoma is more curable than non-Hodgkin's. The cure rate varies according to the type of disease.</p>
<p class=indent>To diagnose lymphoma, doctors remove a portion of a lymph node and examine it for the presence of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. Further tests are done to determine the grade, stage and type of lymphoma. Once the histology of the cancer is completed, the doctor can determine what treatment will be most effective ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radiation, chemotherapy or &quot;watch and wait&quot;. In this last category, the doctor will monitor the disease and begin radiation or chemotherapy when cancer cells block an organ.</p>
<p class=indent>This way the drug regimen can be directed at one area instead of throughout the body where it would destroy extensive numbers of healthy cells. Hodgkin's lymphoma may be treated with radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of the two. 
<p class=indent>Non-Hodgkin's is generally treated by chemotherapy or &quot;watch and wait&quot;. In a few cases, radiation is also implemented.</p>

<p class=indent>Environmental toxins such as pesticides can cause lymphoma. Scientists also believe that viruses and bacteria can play a role in contracting the disease. People with HIV, the Epstein-Barr Virus or those taking immunosuppressive drugs are at greater risk for some types of lymphoma. Approximately 30% of all AIDS patients contract lymphoma. </p>

<p class=indent>Specific treatment depends on many factors including the type, and stage of lymphoma and the history and condition of the patient. Oncologists take these into account before recommending a treatment protocol. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation for Hodgkin's disease usually comes from a machine outside the body. It can be limited to a mantle field (such as the neck, chest or lymph nodes under the arm) or involve total nodal irradiation.</p>
<p class=indent>Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy can be taken by pill, or it may be taken intravenously. It is called a systemic treatment because the drugs enter the bloodstream and travel throughout the body. There are many different chemotherapy regimens used to fight lymphoma. Typical treatments for Hodgkin's include MOPP or ABVD or a combination of these drugs. Quite a few regimens exist for NHL, highly dependent on disease type.</p>
<p class=indent>Bone marrow transplantation may be employed when the disease is resistant to other therapies. Because high doses of chemotherapy can destroy healthy bone marrow, the marrow can be replenished by ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> 
<font class=red>1)</font> marrow removed from the body before treatment, frozen, then transfused back to the patient after chemotherapy (autologous), or <br>
<font class=red>2)</font> marrow from a matched brother or sister or a marrow match from an unrelated donor (allogeneic).</p>
