<p CLASS=indent>Here are some general tips on how to be a better sniper. I do have some specialized tips for some maps, I might post those later.
<p><b>Increase your training score on the firing range.</b> I was able to increase mine to 39 and then to 40. It took a long time and many tries but it is possible.

<p><b>Get to know your map.</b> Practice the map offline to get the feel of the layout. Of practice online at an empty server.

<p><b>Watch the approach.</b> Watch as OPFOR approaches. Snipe soon and snipe often.

<p><b>Move and move often.</b> If they figure out where you are, your dead. The sniper is a high priority target.

<p><b>When they pop smoke, you pop them.</b> When the smoke is rising I will watch that spot like a hawk. If you see movement, shoot! Remember they are using smoke to cover. Some people will sit right in the middle, so it doesn't hurt to make an estimated guess.  This tactic works very well if you can keep your team out of the smoke. (I can't tell you how many times I've been accused of using a smoke hack, lol)

<p><b>Headshots are not required.</b> Remember you don't have to get a head shot to get a kill with the sniper rifle. Too many people waste time and effort looking for the perfect headshot. The head is a small target aim for the body. 

<p><b>Communicate.</b> Listen for and request enemy locations. Also make sure to know where your team is at all times, you want to avoid that ROE. Make sure you warn them when you clear the smoke. 

<p><b>Get a real backup weapon.</b> As soon as you can get another weapon to use as backup once opfor rushes your position. A pistol is ok, but a saw is better. Don't get stuck in a gunfight with a bb gun! Wolf ignore this advice because all <b>you</b> really need is the m9. ;)

<p><b>Grab a buddy.</b> Get one of your teammates to spot for you and cover you when opfor rushes. Work as a unit.

<p><b>Watch the tracers.</b> When opfor shoots at you follow the tracers back to the source. This is by far the easiest way to take out the man with the saw.

<p><b>Stay low and go slow.</b>  The lower you are and the slower you go the harder it will be for OPFOR to see you, and once they find you it's only a matter of time before your dead.

<p><b>Most important: DON'T RUSH!</b> If you have the sniper rifle, don't rush anything! Your job is to hang back and snipe. If you can't be patient and you must rush ... <u>YOUR NOT A SNIPER</u> ... give the gun to someone that can use it.  A good sniper is a horrible thing to waste. Your hurting not helping your team when you rush. Stop giving opfor another sniper rifle.

<p><b>Check your ego at the door.</b> This is one of my bigest pet peaves in the game. There are way to many people out there that want the gun for prestige. They hog the sniper rifle but don't have the patience or skill to use it. (Same thing goes with the saw) I am can be a very good sniper if my mind is in the right place, but if I'm not "feeling it" I don't take the sniper slot. Taking the sniper slot so you can get a good rushing spot is not acceptible. I know a couple of our {S&S} members take this spot just so they can rush with pistol. This is a waste of time and I really wish you would stop it. I don't understand why people act like this this. AA is a team game and you should act like it.
