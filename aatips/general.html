<p>Here a some tips and hints that some of you may be aware of.  This is mainly for the the newer guys to the AA game and those of you that may not have known these things.

<p><b>Check your graphic settings.</b> In your graphics settings in the game screen you can turn on and turn off a whole lot of stuff.  If you just installed the game and just started playing it then this tip will help you so much. I have an ATI 9700pro 128mb card. I can turn every setting up to it's highest and play the game.  If you can do this than you can see graphic effects that other players with less powerfull pcs can't. If you can't turn them all up, then turn them up as high as you can without crashing the game. Make sure you turn your shadows on to full, this makes corner shots a whole lot easier.

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Check your sound settings.</b> Tweak this as much as your sound card, and speakers allow. I have 7.1 surround via a creative soundblaster card. It rocks! If you tune your settings just right you can hear OPFOR miles away. Ok that's an exageration, but not by much. On mout mckenna I can hear OPFOR pull nade pins at spawn. On bridge I stand at spawn and can hear OPFOR when they reach their tower. Hopefully you all have figured out already to turn off your music. This way you can hear the footsteps, ladder noises, beeps, clicks, and whipers that OPFOR make.  

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Smoke, smoke, smoke.</b> If you rush, use smoke to cover because most poeple haven't figured out how to defeat smoke, without spamming. If you run into someone that does know how to defeat smoke, like me, change tactics. Pop smoke and then change directions and fall back, don't use it for cover. If OPFOR rushes into the smoke hoping to catch you off guard, you flank and do the same, you will walk right up behind them and make the kill.  Or even better, you look for the sniper. A good sniper should be watching the smoke for easy kills. When a sniper is looking through the scope they are the most vulnable. And as long as you are not near the smoke they shouldn't see you until you kill them.

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Check the smoke!</b> Ok here is how you defeat smoke and get amazing smoke shots. Caution, if you do this which is perfectly legal and only makes common sense, you may get accused of having a no smoke hack, by those people that just don't get it. Think about it, when do you pop smoke? Cover right? I know your going to run into the smoke. And if I am close enough when you pop smoke, I will rush too. I'm going to run in there to get you. Most often, face to face, but sometimes I'll walk right up behind you. And if I am the sniper when you pop smoke I will be watching that region like a hawk, and if it moves I shoot it, sometimes I get my own team (although I have learned to stop shooting if they enter smoke).

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Get the sniper!</b> A good OPFOR sniper is a horrible thing not to waste. Try to get the sniper as soon as possible. Once the sniper is gone your job gets a lot easier.

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Support your sniper!</b> If you have a good sniper then support him. He is your best asset. Call out OPFOR positions and let the sniper make the shots. Sure you want to increase you kill rate, but come on do what's best for the team. Remember the sniper has very limited field of vision. Once OPFOR crosses over and closes in on the sniper, he's going to need your help. No matter how good a person is with the pistol, it doesn't compare to the saw or a well placed nade.

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Use your nades!</b> Cook your nades before you toss them, if you don't then OPFOR can get out of way before the explosion.  Make sure you know where your team mates are when you decide to toss a nade. You are responsible for your nades and if you tk them because you were careless, then you only have yourself to blame. Practice, practice, practice. The only way to get good with nades is to practice. You should practice your nade toss'n offline with the map you are planning to play. 

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Practice, practice, practice.</b> Pratice with nades, and the different weapons. Get to know every square inch of the map. Get to know your weapon. With the proper practice you can learned to almost completely negates the recoil effect of the SAW. 

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Tactics use them!</b> What I mean by this is that I fight with my head not my gun. Anybody can fire a gun and rush. I am not the type of person that rushes headlong into the firefight. I am always thinking about my suroundings and what OPFOR is doing. Sure there are times when I'm in a bad mood for example and am more likely to rush than think. But for the most part, I go slow and I stay low. There is a time to rush and there is a time to fall back. Be willing to adapt. I can't tell you how many people I run into that are so narrow minded that they will not adapt. 

<p>Some of you have told me, "Well I always rush". Well good for you. When your playing a new player that works great, but once you showdown with a player that knows the game and tactics well, your going to loose more than you win. Most often when that happens, you start thinking your facing a hacker. The ones that go all out and try to rake in the kills don't bother me. The guys that change tactics, adapt to my actions, and are more thoughtful are the guys I worry about going against.

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Play Mout Mckenna.</b> The mout is a great map for beginners, and here is why. It's a huge game of capture the flag, which we should all know how to play from growing up. Also it is a hard map, that forces you to use and change tactics. The map is almost 3d, your enemies can come from all directions including below and above. It's the perfect place to learn to use shadows. Because all the objectives are indoors, and the outdoors aren't that foggy the shadows effects are excellent.

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Report in soldier!</b> The single most important part of working together with your team is reporting. I have a 5 button mouse and one button is setup to report my position. The more you report the less likely you are to be killed by your own team. Be sure to report, before using a nade. I have a keybind setup to radio my team that I am using a nade and to report in. If you choose not to report and you go BOOM from my nade, I am sorry, however you were warned for a reason. Also remember to report enemy sightings. And if you are pinned down by OPFOR, radio for help.

<p><hr width="300">

<p><b>Give the medics a break.</b> I honestly hate being medic, I really wish I could undo my training. Too many people out there are just rude and mean to their medics, and most of the time it's their own behavior that is the problem not the medics.

<p><u>Be aware</u> that when you call for a medic you are shouting it! Opfor can hear you just as well as the medic can. So make one call and then stop, or else OPFOR is going to close in and kill both you and the medic. 

<p><u>Be patient</u> the medic will help you as soon as they can. It's your fault your bleeding not the medics. 

<p><u>Be smart</u> don't expect the medic to help you while risking his/her life, just because you are being stupid. They should heal you if they can get to you, but don't expect them to stop in the middle of the open road to do it. Why give the OPFOR two kills for the price of one? 

<p><u>Cover the medic.</u> If you and the medic are both pinned down, then I guess your both out of luck. 

<p><u>Don't shoot at the medic</u> There are other ways to get the medics attention without making him bleed. If you get inpatient and shoot at me to get my attention, I WILL SHOOT BACK and it might not be a warning shot. Don't be rude! 

<p><u>Become a medic</u> if you haven't done your medic training then you have no right to complain about medics. If you can't be bothered to do the training then in my opinion you have no right to complain about your medic. Being a medic can get your honor up fast, but it's not worth the trouble you have to deal with in my opinion. There are to many jerks our there that make the medics life miserable.
