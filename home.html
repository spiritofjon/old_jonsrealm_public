<p class=indent>Hello and welcome to my website. I have created this site as a hobby. Since my family and I live some distance from the rest of our relatives this also serves as a good way to keep in touch.

<p>This was the very first website I ever created. It was hand crafted using windows notepad. It was called "Jon's Realm" and was online from roughly 1998 until 2008. Over those years it was hosted on a wide variety of webhosts and domain names, both free and paid. Remember Geocities? It was a very minimalistic website and didn't see a whole lot of traffic outside of my family. This site mainly served as my vehicle for learning to code html, css, and javascript. 
<p>In the later years I would go on to co-host Kingsley Family Living room with my father. By the time that site came along I had a pretty good handle on things and I was using KFL mainly to help my father along his path of learning website coding. Sadly I couldn't find a backup of that site and my father passed several years ago. Man I wish I had kept of copy of that now that he is no longer around.
<p>I recently stumbled across the backup files of this site and thought I would throw them online for a bit of nostalgia. Be warned that this site is mostly as it existed back in 2008.
<p>I removed every e-mail link I could find since I no longer have access to that address. I removed the entire passworded section which at the time held encrypted data such as contacts, passwords, and even pc backup files. Other than those minor changes this site is exactly as it appeared back in the day.  As a result come links may not work and some resources used throughout the site may no longer exist. Once such example is a program that I used to encypt my e-mail address on the site to prevent web crawlers from leaching it and spamming me into oblivion.
